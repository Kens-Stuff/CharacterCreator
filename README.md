# CharacterCreator
Several scripts working toward a character sheet PDF generator for DND 5e with NPCs and PCs in mind.
Also an experiment in the quality of code I can generate from chatGPT.
lesson learned, it got me started in the right direction, several times over, difficulty with more precise details.
TODO:
These files need comparison and being unified into a more coherent single project
